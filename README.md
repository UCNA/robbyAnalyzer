# robbyAnalyzer
Copy of the Robert Pattie UCNA analyzer

This is the BASE version of the code I got from Robby - there have been no fixes/tweaks/anything to it to make it work.  I'm editing this afte the fact, so I've already forgotten if there are any required fixes to make it compile under ROOT 5.34, but it's not a hard problem to work out.

Does NOT compile with ROOT 5.99 - that's a debug/developmental version of ROOT that conflicts in substantial ways.
