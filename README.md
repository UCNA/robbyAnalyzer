Functional in ROOT 5.34, nonfunctional in ROOT 5.99

Updates from work since June 2015.  Cleaned up plotting, etc.  Most added code is commented-out debug tools.

This is a complete, tested version of the base code (updated from the 06/12/2015 repository).  Most of the changes fall into two categories: either adding debug/test lines of code, or cleaning up the plotting function to not run into memory issues.
